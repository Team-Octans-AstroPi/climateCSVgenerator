# ClimateCSVgenerator
This repository includes a few scripts that were used to generate the climate CSV dataset for training our climate classification model.

## Content description:
- `ndvi_weatherkit.py` is the main code. This cycles through all the images and gets location and time data, which is used to get data from the [WeatherKit REST API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/weatherkitrestapi) and the [climateapi.scottpinkelman.com](http://climateapi.scottpinkelman.com) API. Then, a modified version of [imageSeparationCV2](https://github.com/Team-Octans-AstroPi/imageSeparationCV2) computes NDVI and plant health. After that, all the data is stored in the CSV.
- `getcloudinfo.py` and `getlandinfo.py` are used to add cloud and land type information to the CSV. Each requires a path to a folder, which has a subfolder for each type.
- `fliternight.py` is used to remove the night photos inside the CSV. This must be done after running `getlandinfo.py`, since the Land Type model is the one whych includes night detection.
