# ClimateCSVgenerator
This repository includes a few scripts that were used to generate the climate CSV dataset for training our climate classification model.

## Content description:
- `ndvi_weatherkit.py` is the main code. This cycles through all the images and gets location and time data. Then, it uses which computes plant health as in imageSeparationCV2, gets the climate
- `getcloudinfo.py` and `getlandinfo.py`
